> [!WARNING]
> VX is currently in development and is not fully released. Installation methods may be unstable, with the Microsoft Edge Store being the only currently supported option: [MS Edge Store](https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/vx/cdjpfngmglnndcjclhdnmbhfkakbelig).

## VX Overview
VX is a lightweight client modification for [Discord](https://discord.com/), compatible with both the desktop application and web browser versions.

## Installation Guide
### Desktop Application
Currently, VX does not support a reliable installation method on the Discord desktop app. 

There will be an install method here shortly

### Browser Extension

> [!CAUTION]
> Be aware of potential high memory and CPU usage, which can cause Discord to crash or reload unexpectedly. This issue is likely related to Microsoft Edge rather than VX itself, as opening DevTools in Edge can also trigger increased resource consumption.
